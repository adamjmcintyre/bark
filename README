Bark's a (not really) fancy way to manage running JavaScript code on a given page. 

Basically, you can define a set of modules to run for a given selector. If that selector's present on a page, your code runs; if it's not, it won't.

Why's that useful? Well, if you're a fan of the module pattern, you'll probably wind up doing something like this over and over and over:

$(document).ready(function(){
    if($(body).hasClass('foo'){
        // do this
    }
    else if($(body).hasClass('bar'){
        // do something else
    }
})

Why not keep it DRY and let something handle that for you?
